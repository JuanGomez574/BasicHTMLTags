    <h1>Favorite NBA Players</h1>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Choosing Three</h2>
    <p>I've been watching the NBA for about 17 years, and I've witnessed so many amazing NBA players. The 
        challenge will be narrowing that list down. I will choose my top three favorites since the time 
        I've been watching.
    </p>

    <h2>Top Three</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dwyane Wade</li>
        <li>LeBron James</li>
        <li>Steph Curry</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dwayne Wade</h3>
    <p>Growing up, one of my first memories of basketball was when Dwyane Wade carried the Miami Heat
        in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_NBA_Finals" target="_blank">2006 NBA Finals</a>
        2006 NBA finals, coming back from down 0-2 to win the championship. I also liked his slashing
        style of basketball.
    </p>
    
    <h3>LeBron James</h3>
    <p>LeBron is a legendary player, probably the second best ever behind Michael Jordan. When he
        joined the Miami Heat to form a superteam with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh I was thrilled. Then
        when he came back from being down 1-3 to the Warriors, that really cemented him into one 
        of my favorites.
    </p>

    <h3>Steph Curry</h3>
    <p>He is one of the most exciting players to watch. His exceptional 3-point shooting skills made
        me a fan.
